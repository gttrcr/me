The majority of scientific researches and publications are produced by people who belong to the academic world (especially universities or public or private research centres) and who carry out research works on the basis of projects research approved and funded. As scientific director, I conduct research for private companies but at the end of the day the work doesn't end because curiosity keeps asking new questions. So it seemed natural to me to start looking for other people who carried out quality research activities driven by curiosity and the desire for knowledge. I've found a huge amount of articles dealing with this and other similar issues:
1. [Doing research outside of academia, without a Phd?](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/531/doing-research-outside-of-academia-without-a-phd)
2. [Do journals in general have any kind of policy regarding papers submitted by someone without a research affiliation?](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/385/do-journals-in-general-have-any-kind-of-policy-regarding-papers-submitted-by-som)
3. [Is it possible to conduct research if I'm not associated with a university or scientific institution?](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-conduct-research-if-Im-not-associated-with-a-university-or-scientific-institution)

6. [How do I do research on my own?](https://qr.ae/pGUiuE)
7. [If you are from a non-academic background, can you still publish your research work in academic journals?](https://qr.ae/pr7fAJ)
8. [How can I conduct research which qualifies as academic without being linked to any academic institution?](https://qr.ae/pr7fFK)
9. [Is there a gap between the scientific and non-scientific community?](https://www.editage.com/insights/is-there-a-gap-between-the-scientific-and-non-scientific-community)
10. [What role should non-academics have in evaluating the potential impact of new research projects?](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2021/08/25/what-role-should-non-academics-have-in-evaluating-the-potential-impact-of-new-research-projects/)
11. [How to Spin Your Scientific Research Out Of a University and Into a Startup](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/8f-how-to-spin-your-scientific-research-out-of-a-university-and-into-a-startup)

Just to mention the most interesting articles.

*So there are many people with a degree, or more, who, driven by their work or passion, would like to be able to carry on their research, and perhaps publish it if it leads to interesting results.*
