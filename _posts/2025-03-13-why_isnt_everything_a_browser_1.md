After years of fighting against the logic of web programming (a fight mostly in vain), the web is not its programming language, but its logic. The web, as we know it today, is built on a foundation of programming languages that have evolved over the years to create everything from simple static pages to complex web applications. 

1. The web was born in **1991** when Tim Berners-Lee created **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** as a way to structure web pages.
2. HTML alone wasn't enough for dynamic content, so developers used **CGI (Common Gateway Interface)** scripts written in languages like **Perl** and **C** to generate dynamic web pages.
3. **JavaScript (1995)** was introduced by Netscape to enable interactive elements on web pages, making it possible to create dynamic content without server-side processing.
4. Around the same time, **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** was introduced to separate style from structure, allowing for better web design.
5. **Java (1995)** and **PHP (1995)** emerged as server-side languages, providing more powerful ways to handle backend logic.
6. **PHP, ASP.NET, and Java Servlets** became widely used for backend development.
7. **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)** allowed for smoother user experiences by enabling web pages to update content without refreshing.
8. **Ruby on Rails (2005)** made web development faster and more efficient by promoting convention over configuration.
9. **jQuery (2006)** simplified JavaScript, making it easier to manipulate HTML and handle events.
10. The rise of **single-page applications (SPAs)** led to frameworks like **AngularJS (2010), React (2013), and Vue.js (2014)**.
11. On the backend, **Node.js (2009)** allowed JavaScript to be used for server-side development.
12. **TypeScript** (a superset of JavaScript) became popular for its strong typing and better maintainability.
13. **JAMstack** (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) grew as a modern web architecture.
14. **WebAssembly (Wasm)** opened the door for high-performance web applications using languages like Rust, C++, and Go.
15. AI and machine learning integration are shaping the future of web development.

But the history of the web and its programming languages ​​did not evolve by itself. Alongside the web there have always been (before the web itself) applications with which the user interacts on a daily basis.

The journey of application development and distribution has evolved dramatically, from early standalone software to today's cloud-based and AI-powered applications. It was not easy to identify them but, broadly speaking, the stages in the history of software development and distribution are as follows.

|        | **Development**                                                  | **Distribution**                                                             |

Finally, we can also identify challenges in the history of computing, in the very history of software development, application distribution and web development

|        | **Development Challenges**                                                                        | **Distribution Challenges**                                                                  |

It would also be possible to study the interesting relationships between the challenges of computer science and the programming languages ​​that generate/solve them, but this goes beyond our reflection today. I want to conclude the first part of this blog with a small summary of what the challenges of the past have been and what, probably, will be challenges. Below is a table listing three-word summaries of the main past and future challenges for each category with supporting references for further reading.
