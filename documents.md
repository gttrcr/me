* As a senior researcher
  * my research activity in mathematics ranges from number theory to Riemannian manifolds. I have a great passion for physics and computer science but I have always thought that mathematics is the art of ideas, the study of the logic of thought under which it was possible to describe what the human intellect knows and communicates.
* As a co-founder
  * I am the technical director at the company I co-founded that deals with the integration of technologies and the simplification of technological processes by moving the complexity from use to development. The future of technology is TRUE process simplification and the shifting of complexity into the development process.
* As a human
  * I let it be, the one be the whole, the Universe act and the higher will be done. She knows the right way.
