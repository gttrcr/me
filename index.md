* As a senior researcher
  * my research activity in mathematics ranges from number theory to Riemannian manifolds. I have a great passion for physics and computer science but I have always thought that mathematics is the art of ideas, the study of the logic of thought under which it was possible to describe what the human intellect knows and communicates.
* As a co-founder
  * I am the technical director at the company I co-founded that deals with the integration of technologies and the simplification of technological processes by moving the complexity from use to development. The future of technology is TRUE process simplification and the shifting of complexity into the development process.
* As a human
  * I let it be, the one be the whole, the Universe act and the higher will be done. She knows the right way.

*All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason.*
Immanuel Kant.

This sentence from Kant was my starting point from which I discovered the greatness of the human region and the existence of what transcends it: the spirit that tends to the supersensible to which man can approach through awareness: the intimate and deep knowledge of the whole. These are not the object of interest of mathematics, but perhaps in the future they will become. The research continues...
