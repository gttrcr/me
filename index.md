**Senior Researcher**: My research in mathematics spans from number theory to Riemannian manifolds, particularly in statistical manifolds and information theory. While I have a deep passion for physics and computer science, I see mathematics as the art of ideas, an exploration of the logic of thought that enables us to describe, understand, and communicate human knowledge.

**Co-Founder & Technical Director**: As the technical director of the company I co-founded, I focus on integrating technologies and simplifying technological processes by shifting complexity from the user experience to the development phase. True technological progress lies in genuine process simplification, ensuring that complexity serves development rather than obstructing usability.

**Philosophy**: Let the one be the whole, the Universe act, and the higher will be done. She knows the right way.

  All our knowledge begins with the
  <br>senses, proceeds then to the 
  <br>understanding, and ends with reason.
  <br> There is nothing higher than reason.
  <br><br>Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason
</div>

This sentence from Kant was my starting point from which I discovered the greatness of the human region and the existence of what transcends it: the spirit that tends to the supersensible to which man can approach through awareness: the intimate and deep knowledge of the whole. These are not the object of interest of mathematics, but perhaps in the future they will become. The research continues...
